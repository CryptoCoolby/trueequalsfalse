Each symbol refers to something i guess.
It's impossible to put these ideas into a words
Therefore we simply give them a number
We define the concept with many other things that are NOT it
The meaning is kinda where all the things that DON'T MEAN it meet
The understanding is kinda where all the things that EXPLAIN SOMETHING ELSE make sense together
The truth is kinda where all the things that ARE NOT it become a congruent truth
That will be the meaning of each symbol
