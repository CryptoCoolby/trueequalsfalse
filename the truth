Elevator pitch
Your intelligent brain is super smart but your emotions together with logical thinking can twist the information before it reaches the intelligent part of your brain.
Your intelligent brain is constantly evolving but the way your emotional logic works is fixed.
You get what you want when your intelligent thinking outgrows your emotional logic.
You get what you want when your intelligent thinking can have the truth.

Introduction
  be a student not a follower

  whats the difference between the truth and the lie
  lie and truth at the same time

  you can change the people around you

  communication - understanding / misunderstanding
  - swarm of jellyfish singing
  beliefs - encrypt - sound - hear - decrypt - beliefs
  attempt the impossible ready?


  Mind (5 hindrances)
  Face it, but not follow

  No control (need for control, forgiveness, easy, autoomatic)
  Change
  You don't exist

The present moment

- If we stop time
- lasts forever
- time doesn't make sense
- nothing changes
- the current slice of reality
- the only existing thing
- the brain only operates here
- everything is happening here
- nothing is happening here
- the tick of the universe
- the tick of the mind

====================================

The brain's event loop:

- This is how the brain operates in each moment
- The mind loop
- sense > process > act > adjust

====================================

sense
- See
- Hear
- Feel
- Smell
- Taste
- Awareness

process
- intelligence
- logic

act
- move
- think

adjust
- beliefs
- habits
- change
- intentions

====================================

Feel
- All bodily sensations

  A few examples:
  - Touch
  - Temperature
  - Pain
  - Wind
  - Some emotions
  - Hunger
  - Sleepiness

====================================

Awareness
- The thoughts in your head that your conscious mind recognizes
- Thoughts that your unconscious categorizes as important
- Thoughts that stick to your attention
- habitual
- Can be anything you see, hear, think, imagine etc..

====================================

intelligence
- Neural network in your brain
- Automatic background process
- It's state (habits + beliefs) determines your actions (sense > process > act)
- always changing (adjust)
- Unconscious | No judgement | No intentions
- You give it a task and it just solves it

====================================

Logic
- habitual
- Beliefs > Rationalize > Result
- Only correct when all information in the process is correct and there are no missing pieces
- Missing / Incorrect

====================================

Move
- habitual
- All movements of the body
- Walking, touching, eating, looking, breathing etc..

====================================

Think
- automatic
- The dance of the jellyfish

====================================

Beliefs
- not on and off, it can go from weak to strong (confidence | attachment)
- Things you think is true about the world based on the collection of your experiences
- Not necessarily the objective truth
- just a set of ideas you developed during your whole life

====================================

Habit
- Your mind's automatic course of action
- it just happens, it's AUTOMATIC
- not on and off, it can go from weak to strong (attachment)
- The processes that are invoked by the Unconscious when a set of conditions meet
- repeated actions become a habity
- The way neurons in your brain are triggered
- cue > action
- Cause > effect
- sense > act

====================================

State of Mind
- The collective of your current beliefs in any given moment
- The collective of your current habits in the present moment
- The current way your neurons are connected in your brain
- The way your neural network has been trained in your entire life leading to this point
- The state of the unconscious mind

====================================

Change
- your habits and beliefs are in constant change
- your mind is constantly breaking and creating habits and beliefs automatically
- We change wheather we want it or not
- We change wheather we know it or not
- unintentional change (dont want and/or dont know)
- intentional change (want and know)

====================================

Intention
- We sense (hear/see) something in the world and as a causation we develop intentions

====================================

intentional Change
- habitual
- when you BELIEVE that you are aware why you do what you do when you do it and it derives from your current habits
- it can only happen in the present
- this is how you create or break habits intentionally
- Awareness + Focus (Willpower)

====================================

Focus / Willpower
- The force you need to use to override a habitual action

====================================

Confidence
- The strength of your beliefs
- When your habits and beliefs are in sync

====================================

Attachment
- The unwillingness to let go of a belief / habit
- Entertaining a belief with positive emotions creates attachment
- Creates greed and delusion

====================================

Rationalize
- The mind takes what it senses in the present moment and looks throught it's store of beliefs to create a story that seems rational
- Given enough time to think the mind will ALWAYS find a story that seems good
- When all the beliefs (info) the story is based on is correct the story will represent the objectie truth
- When some info is missing you get doubt
- When some info is wrong (you have contradicting beliefs) you get worry
- Thoughts from the source of logic based on beliefs

====================================

Insight
- The thoughts the come to your awareness from the subconscious
- The thought output from your neural network
- This is how new understanding is created
- These are the thoughts that point you in the direction of achieving your goal
- Something like a hunch
- Thoughts from the source of intelligence based on real world experience

====================================

Emotion
- bodily sensation + thoughts in the awareness

====================================

Want
- Positive emotion with a thought
- The brain does this to get a reward or avoid danger
- The driving force of the actions you take based on our current state of mind
- Creates attachment

====================================

Craving
- Ill wanting
- Conflicting wanting
- Mixed emotions with a thought

====================================

Worry
- negative bodily feeling and a belief/thought/thoughts
- you came to a false conclusion at one point now it's haunting you
- the indicator for conflicting beliefs
- the only time this is useful is when you use it to backtrack what beleifs are fucking you up
- you get this when you are greedy and delueded
- caused by attachment to the beliefs that are causing it
- will keep coming back until you detach from all the beliefs around it

====================================

Doubt
- the indicator for missing beliefs
- you need more information/experience

====================================

Anger
- We get this when things don't happen the way we want
- We are attached to an outcome and it doesnt happen
- Caused by the need for control

====================================

Laziness
- It's a habit
- it's a belief
- it's attachment to a belief "I'm lazy"

====================================

Judgement
- Mind fabrications
- The mind's tendency to create understanding around everything it sees
- It usess it's current beleifs to do so
- can be good or bad, can be accurate or not
- a blind guess
- you see, hear, smeell, feel, taste something and jump to a conclusion
- a guess from the unconscious
- the best guess of your neural network about something in the present moment
- snap judgement
- a type of insight
- usually triggers the rationalization process (aka logic loop)

====================================

Logic loop
- Insight > Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize and so on
- When you keep thinking, applying logic to your thoughts
- The more you let this process run the more bullshit you will have to deal with
- Only useful when you have all the correct beliefs involved in the proccess
- When a belief is missing your mind will fill it in with some fabrications
- When a belief is missing you get doubt
- when a belief is incorrect your mind will rationaize it anyway
- when a belief is incorrect you get worry

====================================

Inaction
- When you want something but your state of mind blocks you from taking action
- the bullshit in your head convinces you to be like this
- the result of the logic loop
- result of lazyness
- worry and doubt cause this
- the voice in your head cause this when you listen to it for long enough

====================================

Detaching
- When you are attached to a belief and it's giving you worries
- Detach yourself from that belief
- That belief is blocking you from seeing the truth
- Accept the opposite of that belief
- Your mind can create so much bulllshit for you so you must be able to generate some bulllshit for your brain
- Use the logic loop to bullshit your brain back
- Use the fucked up rationalization process to convince yourself why this belief is not true
- Create a reason why you really don't need to be attached
- Create a reason why you really don't need this belief
- Fabricate a reason why this belief is false
- When you don't want it you get it

====================================

Greed
- Attachment to a belief
- Attachment to an outcome
- The result of positive emotions + thinking

====================================

Delusion
- Rationalized bullshit
- The creation of a logic loop running loose
- Because you are attached to the belief that's giving you worriees
- Because you let your logical mind think when you really shouldn't
- Feeds your subconscious with trash
- Feeds your neural network with false information
- Cause of bad actions
- Not your fault
- The fault of your beliefs and habits

====================================

Simple cause effect
- habits
- a simple if this then that
- you sense something then something happens
- see a cola - craving for a sip
- hear a mosquito - anger
- read some weird ideas - think it's not true and dno't try to understand the truth behind it
- see food + feel full = and eat it thinking that you must eat it because you waste it otherwise and ignoring the fact that it's not good for your body
- to break it you simply need to create the situation
- expose yourself to the situation and break the result meaning not do what your habit dictates
- change this with intentional change

====================================

Past
- doesn't exist
- you can't change it
- a subset of your beliefs
- thoughts about the past are only useful when you learn something new and then realize why something happened, this process happens automaticlly and comes through insights all further thinking is just creating bulllshit
- thinking about the past when you get doubt anger or worry tells you something
- thinking about the past is a great opportunity to bullshit yourself and create some suffering
- you only safe here if you forgive yourself and everybody

====================================

Future
- doesn't exist
- you don't know it
- you can't change it
- a subset of your beliefs
- thoughts about the future are only useful when you learn something new and then realize something might happen, this process happens automaticlly and comes through insights all further thinking is just creating bulllshit
- thinking about the future is a great opportunity to bullshit yourself and create some suffering
- thinking about it is great if you can instantly detach yourself from everything you predict
- you're only safe here if you accept any and every outcome

====================================

Testing
- The tool to confirm your beleifs
- Try to prove your belief
- Try to prove the opposite of oour belief
- Test it in the real world
- make it happen in the moment
- recreate in the presennt moment
- make sure you have no doubts and worries around this belief
- test it with others
- make sure other people are also "test" your belief the same way and reach the same conclusion
- never attach to the beleif even if you tested it even the truth is changing so after a while you revisit and might find that it's no longer true
- you can never be sure

====================================

impermanence
- Nothing is forever everything is changing,
- you never have the same moment twice
- you never have the same state of mind twice
- nothing is permanent

====================================

no control

====================================

need for control

====================================

Peace of mind
- when your beliefs are not in conflict
- when the weights in your neural network is balaned out
- when your jellyfish sing in harmony
- when you removed every single belief that have been holding you back
- when you unlearn the final piece of bullshit from all the lies you learned in your life to this moment
- when you are no longer attached to any belief
- when you don't get anxiety anymore
- when you don't doubt anymore
- when you only think when it's time to think
- when you're hungry you eat
- when you are not hungry you stop eating
- when people don't judge you
- when you're not attached to any of your beliefs anymore
- when you are aware of all your senses
- when you know where each thought is coming from
- when you know thyself
- when your ego is just a lunatic storyteller
- when true === false
- when you lock in in the present moment
- when you're not lazy anymore
- when you see the truth in the lie
- when you see the lie in the truth
- when I look for my mind I cannot find it
- when you dont want it you get it
- when you're back where you started
- when you dont worry anymore
- when you're not angry anymore
- and the opposite of all of the above and you know it
