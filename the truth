Elevator pitch
Your intelligent brain is super smart but your emotions together with logical thinking can twist the information before it reaches the intelligent part of your brain.
Your intelligent brain is constantly evolving but the way your emotional logic works is fixed.
You get what you want when your intelligent thinking outgrows your emotional logic.
You get what you want when your intelligent thinking can have the truth.
Emotion driven logic is the source of all bad things we create.

Introduction
  Do this for nobody but yourself!
  Fuck everybody!
  You are the most important in the universe, Save yourself! YOU DESERVE PEACE!
  You are the world, you are everything.

  be a student not a follower
  listen to these words but don't take them as they are. Make up your own mind
  you can only understad this if you read through the end
  your emotions will try very hard to stop you from reading to the end - namely, anger, worry, doubt, laziness and cravings

  whats the difference between the truth and the lie
  find both the lie and truth at the same time
  Therefore if you read something that's bullshit hold tight until you get to the end
  I can only explain this with a bunch of bullshit
  true === false

  you can change the people around you
  - truth: you can change people when they want also change
  - lie: you cant channge people when they don't listen to your advice
  - truth: you can walk away from people and surround yourself with a new group of people instead
  - lie: you can't walk away from people when you are forced (e.g. you are stuck with your collegues and you bullshit yourself that you must keep this job)
  - and so on there are an infinite number of true and false interpretations of each sentence
  - now it's your turn to find the truth in the lies

  communication - understanding / misunderstanding
  - swarm of jellyfish singing
  beliefs - encrypt - sound - hear - decrypt - beliefs
  attempt the impossible ready?


  Mind (5 hindrances)
  Face it, but not follow

  No control (need for control, forgiveness, easy, autoomatic)
  Change
  You don't exist

The present moment

- If we stop time
- lasts forever
- time doesn't make sense
- nothing changes
- the current slice of reality
- the only existing thing
- the brain only operates here
- everything is happening here
- nothing is happening here
- the tick of the universe
- the tick of the mind

====================================

The brain's event loop:

- This is how the brain operates in each moment
- The mind loop
- sense > process > act > adjust

====================================

sense
- See
- Hear
- Feel
- Smell
- Taste
- Awareness

process
- intelligence
- logic

act
- move
- think

adjust
- beliefs
- habits
- change
- intentions

====================================

Feel
- All bodily sensations

  A few examples:
  - Touch
  - Temperature
  - Pain
  - Wind
  - Some emotions
  - Hunger
  - Sleepiness

====================================

Awareness
- The thoughts in your head that your conscious mind recognizes
- Thoughts that your unconscious categorizes as important
- Thoughts that stick to your attention
- habitual
- Can be anything you see, hear, think, imagine etc..

====================================

intelligence
- Neural network in your brain
- Automatic background process
- It's state (habits + beliefs) determines your actions (sense > process > act)
- always changing (adjust)
- Unconscious | No judgement | No intentions
- You give it a task and it just solves it

====================================

Logic
- habitual
- Beliefs > Rationalize > Result
- Only correct when all information in the process is correct and there are no missing pieces
- Missing / Incorrect

====================================

Move
- habitual
- All movements of the body
- Walking, touching, eating, looking, breathing etc..

====================================

Think
- automatic
- The dance of the jellyfish

====================================

Beliefs
- not on and off, it can go from weak to strong (confidence | attachment)
- Things you think is true about the world based on the collection of your experiences
- Not necessarily the objective truth
- just a set of ideas you developed during your whole life

====================================

Habit
- Your mind's automatic course of action
- it just happens, it's AUTOMATIC
- not on and off, it can go from weak to strong (attachment)
- The processes that are invoked by the Unconscious when a set of conditions meet
- repeated actions become a habity
- The way neurons in your brain are triggered
- cue > action
- Cause > effect
- sense > act

====================================

State of Mind
- The collective of your current beliefs in any given moment
- The collective of your current habits in the present moment
- The current way your neurons are connected in your brain
- The way your neural network has been trained in your entire life leading to this point
- The state of the unconscious mind

====================================

Change
- your habits and beliefs are in constant change
- your mind is constantly breaking and creating habits and beliefs automatically
- We change wheather we want it or not
- We change wheather we know it or not
- unintentional change (dont want and/or dont know)
- intentional change (want and know)

====================================

Intention
- We sense (hear/see) something in the world and as a causation we develop intentions

====================================

intentional Change
- habitual
- when you BELIEVE that you are aware why you do what you do when you do it and it derives from your current habits
- it can only happen in the present
- this is how you create or break habits intentionally
- Awareness + Focus (Willpower)

====================================

Focus / Willpower
- The force you need to use to override a habitual action

====================================

Confidence
- The strength of your beliefs
- When your habits and beliefs are in sync

====================================

Attachment
- The unwillingness to let go of a belief / habit
- Entertaining a belief with positive emotions creates attachment
- Creates greed and delusion

====================================

Rationalize
- The mind takes what it senses in the present moment and looks throught it's store of beliefs to create a story that seems rational
- Given enough time to think the mind will ALWAYS find a story that seems good
- When all the beliefs (info) the story is based on is correct the story will represent the objectie truth
- When some info is missing you get doubt
- When some info is wrong (you have contradicting beliefs) you get worry
- Thoughts from the source of logic based on beliefs

====================================

Insight
- The thoughts the come to your awareness from the subconscious
- The thought output from your neural network
- This is how new understanding is created
- These are the thoughts that point you in the direction of achieving your goal
- Something like a hunch
- Thoughts from the source of intelligence based on real world experience

====================================

Emotion
- bodily sensation + thoughts in the awareness

====================================

Want
- Positive emotion with a thought
- The brain does this to get a reward or avoid danger
- The driving force of the actions you take based on our current state of mind
- Creates attachment

====================================

Craving
- Ill wanting
- Conflicting wanting
- Mixed emotions with a thought

====================================

5 Hindrances
- 5 things that prevent you from seeing the truth
- Worry, Laziness, Anger, Doubt, Craving (Wanting)
- 5 things that lead you to the truth

====================================

Worry
- negative bodily feeling and a belief/thought/thoughts
- you came to a false conclusion at one point now it's haunting you
- the indicator for conflicting beliefs
- the only time this is useful is when you use it to backtrack what beleifs are fucking you up
- you get this when you are greedy and delueded
- caused by attachment to the beliefs that are causing it
- will keep coming back until you detach from all the beliefs around it

====================================

Doubt
- the indicator for missing beliefs
- you need more information/experience

====================================

Anger
- We get this when things don't happen the way we want
- We are attached to an outcome and it doesnt happen
- Caused by the need for control

====================================

Laziness
- It's a habit
- it's a belief
- it's attachment to a belief "I'm lazy"

====================================

Judgement
- Mind fabrications
- The mind's tendency to create understanding around everything it sees
- It usess it's current beleifs to do so
- can be good or bad, can be accurate or not
- a blind guess
- you see, hear, smeell, feel, taste something and jump to a conclusion
- a guess from the unconscious
- the best guess of your neural network about something in the present moment
- snap judgement
- a type of insight
- usually triggers the rationalization process (aka logic loop)

====================================

Logic loop
- Insight > Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize >  Awareness > Rationalize and so on
- When you keep thinking, applying logic to your thoughts
- The more you let this process run the more bullshit you will have to deal with
- Only useful when you have all the correct beliefs involved in the proccess
- When a belief is missing your mind will fill it in with some fabrications
- When a belief is missing you get doubt
- when a belief is incorrect your mind will rationaize it anyway
- when a belief is incorrect you get worry

====================================

Inaction
- When you want something but your state of mind blocks you from taking action
- the bullshit in your head convinces you to be like this
- the result of the logic loop
- result of lazyness
- worry and doubt cause this
- the voice in your head cause this when you listen to it for long enough

====================================

Detaching
- When you are attached to a belief and it's giving you worries
- Detach yourself from that belief
- That belief is blocking you from seeing the truth
- Accept the opposite of that belief
- Your mind can create so much bulllshit for you so you must be able to generate some bulllshit for your brain
- Use the logic loop to bullshit your brain back
- Use the fucked up rationalization process to convince yourself why this belief is not true
- Create a reason why you really don't need to be attached
- Create a reason why you really don't need this belief
- Fabricate a reason why this belief is false
- When you don't want it you get it

====================================

Greed
- Attachment to a belief
- Attachment to an outcome
- The result of positive emotions + thinking

====================================

Delusion
- Rationalized bullshit
- The creation of a logic loop running loose
- Because you are attached to the belief that's giving you worriees
- Because you let your logical mind think when you really shouldn't
- Feeds your subconscious with trash
- Feeds your neural network with false information
- Cause of bad actions
- Not your fault
- The fault of your beliefs and habits

====================================

Simple cause effect
- habits
- a simple if this then that
- you sense something then something happens
- it starts to rain - we get anger and we don't move unnder roof
- it starts to rain - we get anger and move unnder roof
- it starts to rain - we don't get anger and we move under roof
- see a cola - craving for a sip
- hear a mosquito - anger
- read some weird ideas - think it's not true and dno't try to understand the truth behind it
- see food + feel full = and eat it thinking that you must eat it because you waste it otherwise and ignoring the fact that it's not good for your body
- to break it you simply need to create the situation
- expose yourself to the situation and break the result meaning not do what your habit dictates
- change this with intentional change

====================================

Past
- doesn't exist
- you can't change it
- a subset of your beliefs
- thoughts about the past are only useful when you learn something new and then realize why something happened, this process happens automaticlly and comes through insights all further thinking is just creating bulllshit
- thinking about the past when you get doubt anger or worry tells you something
- thinking about the past is a great opportunity to bullshit yourself and create some suffering
- you only safe here if you forgive yourself and everybody

====================================

Future
- doesn't exist
- you don't know it
- you can't change it
- a subset of your beliefs
- thoughts about the future are only useful when you learn something new and then realize something might happen, this process happens automaticlly and comes through insights all further thinking is just creating bulllshit
- thinking about the future is a great opportunity to bullshit yourself and create some suffering
- thinking about it is great if you can instantly detach yourself from everything you predict
- you're only safe here if you accept any and every outcome

====================================

Testing
- The tool to confirm your beleifs
- Try to prove your belief
- Try to prove the opposite of oour belief
- Test it in the real world
- make it happen in the moment
- recreate in the presennt moment
- make sure you have no doubts and worries around this belief
- test it with others
- make sure other people are also "test" your belief the same way and reach the same conclusion
- never attach to the beleif even if you tested it even the truth is changing so after a while you revisit and might find that it's no longer true
- you can never be sure

====================================

impermanence
- Nothing is forever everything is changing,
- you never have the same moment twice
- you never have the same state of mind twice
- nothing is permanent
- attaching to anything is already a conflicting belief since nothing is forever but we want to have it forever therefore a source of self imposed suffering
- also when something doesn't happen the way we want it we get angry
- when reality is not what we believe and we are confronted with the truth we get angry
- sorry if you feel angry reading this

====================================

no control
- everything is deterministic
- you can't control the rain
- everything happens for a reason
- the universe is one gigantic agorythm that
- if you don't understand this you explain it with something irrational
- but then you're still getting worries and doubts so solve for X

====================================

need for control
- is a core belief
- when something doesnt happen as we want we get anger
- the emotional rationalization process by default wants control and will do everything in its power from giving the control out to the neural network in your brain
- is a core belief
- ditch it

====================================

Miracle
- anything you don't understand
- it's only a miracle until you understand it
- based on the false belief that it's unexplainable
- if the mind had to admit that it's explainable just the mind don't understand it the mind responds with anger
- if you had to admit that it's explainable just you don't understand it you responds with anger
- you are attached to this belief
- worry doubt anger which one you feel right now?
- if there were things happening without a reason/cause that would violate the laws of the universe and everything would fall apart no?
- how could it be possible that everything in the world is explainable except the human mind? Very creative. That must be a Miracle
- test it, find at least one thing that has been tested and proven to be unexplainable then you can reason about the existence of subjective miracles
- we are bound to happen
- life is bound to come into existence
- it takes a long time oh well..
- what does it matter if there is nobody to wait anyways (intil the first human mind to think about existance developed)
- it has a small chance oh well..
- what does it matter since there is nobody waiting to get lucky until it happens?
- we just happened by chance
- god and devil are just words they have only meaning when you give them meaning and they mean whatever you think they mean
- both god and devil are the implementation of the mind, the way the brain operates
- god is intelligence
- devil is bullshit thoughts caused by emotions and thinking without the intelligence being able to classify and sort thoughts
- you need to train your mind to spot the lies and we are good!
- god is always evolving
- the devil is a fixed algorythm
- the devil is born with full strength but doesnt grow
- god is born without any power but grows
- in todays society not many gods outgrew their devils

====================================

Arising and Ceasing
- The manifestation of impermanence
- Pain comes and pain goes
- Rain come and go
- Life comes and goes
- Friends come and go
- Problems come and go
- Everything comes and goes automatically wheather we want it or not
- Tiredness come and go
- Sadness come and go
- Happiness come and go
- Money comes and goes
- Days come and go
- Thoughts come and go
- Thoughts arise and cease, you can't control it and it's never forever

====================================

Non-self
- This is the point when things are getting super difficult
- At thiss point ego will go super saiyan on your brain
- Don't believe the bullshit you're not insane
- The ego is insane and will use its full power clinging to the fact that it is you and you must obey it's commands
- It knows it's losing control and it's about to collapse, it will be producing mayhem in the mind,
- Remember arising and ceasing. Nothing is permanent nothing is forever, once you are through this your unconscious will fully understand what it's dealing with
- No pain no gain
- At this point there is no going back, just remember what worry, doubt and anger really are. They are mereley indicators for you to know what is real.
- You don't exist
- Your ego wants to exist
- True === False
- Your mind will bullshit you
- Bullshit it back and solve for X
- Solve all conflicting beliefs you have, follow the emotions, backtrack the source of thoughts
- We have the illusion of control in the subjective reality which is nice and in our day to day lives it feels very nice, we can get used to the truth just as we can to any bullshit. dont worry you will still have emotions, you will still feel human
- Once you are through the bullshitstorm you will go back to where you started but you will be the one in conntrol of everything rather than being controlled by everything, you enter godmode

====================================

Forgiveness
- Not forgiving anybody is like not forgiving the rain for falling.
- When the rain falls you either get angry or not. You either forgive mother nature or not.
- Not forgiving anybody for anything is irrational and therefore a source of suffering the mind imposes on itself
- You can't control anything
- Nobody can control anything
- We are the result of a fixed algorythm that runs automatically
- Everything you don't forgive will keep coming back to you and cause suffering and negative emotions
- When this happens it's a great thing because it's your only chance to solve for X, in the present moment. Backtrack your emotions, detach yourself from the causes. And destroy one more belief in your state of mind. There are a finite amount of beleifs causing you suffering. Once you aare through you have piece of mind.

====================================

Face but not follow
- build this habit
- Face every thought but don't follow any thought
- when you worry, acknowledge that you worry, know what's causing it but don't get into the irrationalizing logic loop
- Take the insights and cut the bulllshit
- Learn but don't suffer

====================================

Peace of mind
- when your beliefs are not in conflict
- when the weights in your neural network is balaned out
- when your jellyfish sing in harmony
- when you removed every single belief that have been holding you back
- when you unlearn the final piece of bullshit from all the lies you learned in your life to this moment
- when you are no longer attached to any belief
- when you don't get anxiety anymore
- when you don't doubt anymore
- when you only think when it's time to think
- when you're hungry you eat
- when you are not hungry you stop eating
- when people don't judge you
- when you're not attached to any of your beliefs anymore
- when you are aware of all your senses
- when you know where each thought is coming from
- when you know thyself
- when your ego is just a lunatic storyteller
- when true === false
- when you lock in in the present moment
- when you're not lazy anymore
- when you see the truth in the lie
- when you see the lie in the truth
- when I look for my mind I cannot find it
- when you dont want it you get it
- when you're back where you started
- when you dont worry anymore
- when you're not angry anymore
- when you aren't suffering anymore
- when the neural network in your brain finally gets all the truths to solve the problem
- when your BI (biological intelligence) gets the right samples for training
- when you can tell the difference if a thought is coming from the unconscious or the logical brain
- and the opposite of all of the above and you know why
