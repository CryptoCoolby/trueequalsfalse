Forgiveness
- Not forgiving anybody is like not forgiving the rain for falling.
- When the rain falls you either get angry or not. You either forgive mother nature or not.
- Not forgiving anybody for anything is irrational and therefore a source of suffering the mind imposes on itself
- You can't control anything
- Nobody can control anything
- We are the result of a fixed algorythm that runs automatically
- Everything you don't forgive will keep coming back to you and cause suffering and negative emotions
- When this happens it's a great thing because it's your only chance to solve for X, in the present moment. Backtrack your emotions, detach yourself from the causes. And destroy one more belief in your state of mind. There are a finite amount of beleifs causing you suffering. Once you aare through you have piece of mind.

====================================

Face but not follow
- Face every thought but don't follow any thought
- when you worry, acknowledge that you worry, know what's causing it but don't get into the irrationalizing logic loop
- Take the insights and cut the bulllshit
- Learn but don't suffer
- admit it but don't let it play with you
- acknowledge it and mindfully walk away
- know that there is a bug in the code but don't break the keyboad, flip the table and throw the monitor out the window because without them you won't be able to fix the code

====================================

Mindfulness
- you can only be aware of one thing at a time
- when your logic loop is hurting you this is the tool that breaks the loop
- this is a habit that you need to develop
- the end goal is that you think about not thinking whatever thoughts you don't like and then they leave your awareness
- you need to force your awareness in the present moment
- you follow anything that's happening in the present moment with your awareness
- you say in your head each step of action you take
- washing dishes: open tap, pick up sponge, adding soap, pick up plate, rubbing plate ... etc.
- Keep the thoughts in exact sync with the actions you take
- when something enters through any of the 6 senses you acknowledge it then return to the task
- thoughts will appear
- emotions will appear
- it's very normal
- remember: everything is automatic you have no control over anything so take it easy, don't be hard on yourself and let the AI in your head do what it does. When you're hard on yourself it's still worries doubts and anger. Find out the truth
- each phenomena will arise and cease, never stay with you forever
- sometimes they come back, sometimes they dont
- sometimes they stay sometimes they dont
- sounds, smells, feelings, lazy, angry, hot, dislike, like, etc... (see elements of mindfulness)
- You acknowledge everything when they arise and return to the task at hand immediately when you are aware that your awareness been hijacked
- this way you can develop the habit of face but not follow and protect your neural network from freshly baked bullshit beliefs
- then when your neural network is ready it will send the solution to your awareness in the form of an insight, that's the thought to take action on. That's the thought that leads the way towards your goals.

====================================

Detaching
- When you are attached to a belief and it's giving you worries
- Detach yourself from that belief
- That belief is blocking you from seeing the truth
- Accept the opposite of that belief
- Your mind can create so much bulllshit for you so you must be able to generate some bulllshit for your brain
- Use the logic loop to bullshit your brain back
- Use the fucked up rationalization process to convince yourself why this belief is not true
- Create a reason why you really don't need to be attached
- Create a reason why you really don't need this belief
- Fabricate a reason why this belief is false
- When you don't want it you get it

====================================

elements of mindfulness
- whatever thoughts appear in your awareness you face it, categorize it and acknowledge the category
- body, feeling, mind, mind objects


body
- standing, sitting, lying, walking, moving, all body movements

feeling
- like
- neutral
- dislike

mind
- these are the 5 hindrances, our mind has a tendency to do them from time to time

mind objects
- everything else
- thoughts
- anything that sticks in your awareness
- Categories to acknowledge:
- thinking, knowing, remembering, planning, judging, seeing, hearing,
-  feeling, painful, hot, tired, hungry etc. all bodily sensations
(hungry is not the same as want to eat, hunger is a feeling in your body and want to eat is a craving in the mind)
- so for example you think of your vacation 3 months from now andd your mindd starts thinking about the details.. whenever you catch it with your awareness you say "planning planninng planning", it doesn't matter what you are planning all that mtters is that you realize what your mind started doing and you categorize it then forget about it.
- Maybe you also like this vacation idea then you can say "planning plannning plannng, liking liking liking" then forget about it and return to the present moment, return to mindfulness. You will see planning and liking is for example thoughts with happy emotions in the future that is uncertain so you will develop attachment then you will think about something that can sabotage your vacation and you start worrying then you feel miserable maybe you take some stupid action and in the end you realize that all your thinking was nowhere close to how reality turned out to be and you just wasted your brain power caused yourself to suffer and potentially took some deluded course of action

====================================

intentions
- the way to fight laziness
- you develop the habit that whenever you intend to do something you do it
- habits are actions repeated many times enough
- if you sometimes intend then dont take action you fuck your habit up
- it's much better to not intend at all when you're not sure that you will take action
- how you do it:
 1. find a situation in the present moment that you will do for sure (eg you finish lunch and you are about to stand up from the chair)
 2. before you stand up say to yourself in your mind: "intending to stand up"
 3. when you said it 3 times only after start moving and as you are moving say in your mind 3 times: "standing up"
 4. once you are standing also say in your mind: "standing standing standing"
 - So again:
 1. make sure you will do it, you can feel it by testing wheather your have enough willpower to carry out the task or not. If the voice in your head says I can't do it then no worries, you can practice intent next time!
 1b. When you are certain that you ar going to do it because there is nothinng holding you back:
 2. Declare intent 3 times (stand up or sit down is generally good but you can come up with other things, it's important to note that if it's things that the lazy you would not do it's better to practice with that bbut only when you are sure you are not in a lazy mood, standing up is perfect because the lazy you is usually jusut lying on the coach and stannding up already gets you moving)
 3. Only after you finish declaring intent you carry out the action, acknowledging it in your head
 4. acknowledge the end result
 - Develop this habit of  intentions and onnce it's automatic you can jusut declare intent and your body will do it without any willpower. Always test for willower before you use intention otherwise you will fuck this habit up and you will need to create something else with the same purpose

====================================

ability to stop thinking
- you develop this ability over time by practicing mindfulness, when you acknowledge something and return your focus to the present moment you are strengthenning the neuron connections in your brain that will be responsible for this ability, the stringer those connections beome the less willpower you will need to cut any thought proccess you decide to cut
- when you think about not thinking and the thoughts stop coming
- facing, categorizing and if detected supressing your bullshit thoughts
- you need to admit each thought you have but not follow any of them, so that you can learn from them and over time understand what is causing them and remove the root cause belief but until then you must prevent them to send you into suffer mode
- you need this when you identify a thought that's bullshit
- face it but not follow
